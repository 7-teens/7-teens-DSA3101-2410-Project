    "## 2. Feature Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Data Preparation and Integration\n",
    "The chatbot operates by leveraging three primary datasets:\n",
    "- **Customers Dataset**: This dataset includes key information such as customer IDs, login history, and checkout activity. The chatbot uses this data to track each customer's interaction with the platform and personalize its responses accordingly. \n",
    "- **Orders Dataset**: This dataset records transactional details like order IDs, product IDs, timestamps, and order statuses. It enables the chatbot to respond to customer inquiries regarding their past or current orders, including status updates.\n",
    "- **Products Dataset**: This contains vital product information, such as names, prices, and customer ratings. The chatbot uses this dataset to provide detailed product information and make personalized recommendations based on user behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seamless integration of these datasets is essential to ensure that the chatbot can deliver personalized, real-time responses. Consistent formatting and data type conversions across datasets allow for efficient querying and minimize the risk of data discrepancies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 LLM-Based Natural Language Processing (NLP)\n",
    "The chatbot leverages **DialoGPT**, a pre-trained LLM designed for conversational tasks. This model enables the chatbot to interpret and generate human-like responses to user inputs. Using the LLM, the chatbot can handle diverse queries, including product inquiries, order tracking, and personalized recommendations. DialoGPT's flexibility allows it to generate coherent and contextually appropriate replies to a broad array of customer questions, reducing the need for rule-based systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key advantage of using an LLM is its ability to generalize across different types of queries, making it highly adaptable to various conversational patterns. This eliminates the need to manually program responses for every potential user input, streamlining chatbot development and improving its ability to handle unstructured or unexpected questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Context Management and Memory\n",
    "A core feature of the chatbot is its ability to retain and manage context across multiple user interactions. This feature ensures that the chatbot can recall previous queries and maintain a coherent conversation with the user, providing a seamless experience. For example, if a customer asks about a product and then follows up with a request for its price, the chatbot remembers the product from the previous query and provides the correct information without requiring the customer to repeat themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "This contextual memory is implemented through a dictionary that stores the user’s last product inquiry, intent (e.g., price or rating request), and order information. This significantly improves the efficiency and fluidity of conversations, particularly when handling multi-part queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Core Functionalities\n",
    "The chatbot is designed to address the most common customer needs within the e-commerce platform. Its key functionalities include:\n",
    "- **Customer Information Retrieval**: The chatbot can access and relay customer-specific information, such as login history and past checkout details, allowing it to provide personalized insights based on the customer's prior behavior.\n",
    "- **Product Recommendations**: It suggests products based on a customer's previous purchases. If no purchase history is available, the chatbot recommends popular products, enhancing the user experience with relevant suggestions.\n",
    "- **Order Status Tracking**: Customers can request updates on their orders by providing the order ID, and the chatbot will retrieve and display the relevant details.\n",
    "- **Product Information Queries**: Customers can ask about product prices or ratings, and the chatbot will query the product dataset to provide accurate, real-time responses.\n",

    "## 3. The Implementation Details and Architecture of the LLM-Based System\n",
    "\n",
    "The LLM-based chatbot system is designed to handle customer queries, provide product recommendations, and manage interactions within an e-commerce platform. The architecture integrates a large language model (LLM), data handling components, and context management mechanisms to deliver a fluid and responsive customer support experience. Below are the implementation details and the architecture of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **LLM Integration (DialoGPT)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of the chatbot's conversational ability is powered by **DialoGPT**, a transformer-based language model optimized for dialogue. This pre-trained model is fine-tuned to generate human-like responses based on the context provided by the user input.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Selection**: The system uses **microsoft/DialoGPT-medium** due to its balance of response quality and computational efficiency.\n",
    "- **Tokenization and Encoding**: User input is processed using a tokenizer that prepares the input text for the model. The input is tokenized into a format that the model can understand, allowing for efficient text generation.\n",
    "- **Response Generation**: The chatbot generates responses by sampling from the model's learned distribution of dialogue possibilities. Parameters like **top-k** and **top-p** control the diversity of responses, ensuring that the chatbot produces coherent yet varied answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Loading the DialoGPT model and tokenizer\n",
    "from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n",
    "\n",
    "model_name = \"microsoft/DialoGPT-medium\"\n",
    "tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\n",
    "model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Data Handling and Integration**\n",
    "\n",
    "The chatbot interacts with three primary datasets:\n",
    "- **Customers Dataset**: Stores information about customers, including customer IDs, last login dates, and checkout history. This data allows the chatbot to personalize responses and make recommendations based on user behavior.\n",
    "- **Orders Dataset**: Contains order-related information such as order IDs, product IDs, and timestamps. This dataset is used to provide customers with real-time updates on the status of their orders.\n",
    "- **Products Dataset**: Holds details about the products available in the e-commerce platform, including product names, prices, descriptions, and customer ratings. The chatbot retrieves information from this dataset to answer product-related queries and suggest items to customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data integration is essential for ensuring that the chatbot can access and manipulate these datasets in real-time, providing up-to-date and accurate responses to customer queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Load datasets\n",
    "customers_df = pd.read_csv(\"../Cleaned_Datasets/customer_SG_only.csv\", index_col=0)  # customer data\n",
    "orders_df = pd.read_csv(\"../Cleaned_Datasets/orders_generated.csv\", index_col=0)  # order data\n",
    "products_df = pd.read_csv(\"../Cleaned_Datasets/products_cleaned.csv\", index_col=0)  # product data\n",
    "\n",
    "# Convert customer_id columns to strings in both DataFrames\n",
    "customers_df['customer_id'] = customers_df['customer_id'].astype(str)\n",
    "orders_df['customer_id'] = orders_df['customer_id'].astype(str)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Context Management**\n",
    "- The chatbot maintains context between queries, allowing it to engage in more natural, multi-turn conversations. For example, if a customer asks about a product and later asks about its price, the chatbot remembers the product in question.\n",
    "- Context Storage: A dictionary is used to store details such as the last product mentioned, last customer ID, and last order ID. This information is updated with each interaction to maintain the flow of the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Context management for follow-up queries\n",
    "context = {\n",
    "    \"last_product\": None,  # Stores the last product mentioned\n",
    "    \"last_intent\": None,   # Stores the last intent (price, rating, etc.)\n",
    "    \"last_customer\": None, # Stores last customer ID\n",
    "    \"last_order\": None     # Stores last order ID\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Intent Detection and Query Handling**\n",
    "- The chatbot uses regular expressions (regex) to detect user intent (e.g., asking for order status or product price). Based on the detected intent, the chatbot queries the relevant dataset and retrieves the information requested by the customer.\n",
    "- Response Handling: After determining the user's intent (e.g., asking for product recommendations), the chatbot generates responses by combining the output from datasets and the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Regex-based intent detection\n",
    "def detect_intent_and_entities(user_input):\n",
    "    # Prioritize recommendation detection over customer queries\n",
    "    if \"recommend\" in user_input.lower() and \"customer\" in user_input.lower():\n",
    "        customer_id = re.search(r'\\d+', user_input).group(0)\n",
    "        return \"recommendation\", {\"customer_id\": customer_id}\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Regex patterns to detect customer query intent\n",
    "    if re.search(r'customer.*id.*\\d+', user_input, re.IGNORECASE):\n",
    "        intent = \"customer_query\"\n",
    "        customer_id = re.search(r'\\d+', user_input).group(0)\n",
    "        return intent, {\"customer_id\": customer_id}\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Regex patterns to detect order query intent\n",
    "    if re.search(r'order.*id', user_input, re.IGNORECASE):\n",
    "        intent = \"order_query\"\n",
    "        order_id = re.search(r'order_[0-9]+', user_input, re.IGNORECASE)\n",
    "        return intent, {\"order_id\": order_id.group(0)} if order_id else {\"order_id\": None}\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Regex patterns to detect product price or rating queries\n",
    "    if re.search(r'price|rating', user_input, re.IGNORECASE):\n",
    "        product_name_match = re.search(r'(?:price|rating) of (.+)', user_input, re.IGNORECASE)\n",
    "        product_name = product_name_match.group(1).strip() if product_name_match else None\n",
    "        intent = \"product_price\" if \"price\" in user_input.lower() else \"product_rating\"\n",
    "        return intent, {\"product_name\": product_name}\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Fallback for general queries\n",
    "    return \"general\", {}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **LLM Response Generation**\n",
    "- If no specific intent is detected, the chatbot falls back to LLM-based conversation using DialoGPT, which generates a free-form conversational response based on user input and the dialogue history.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# LLM (DialoGPT) Chat Handling\n",
    "def chat_with_dialoGPT(user_input, chat_history_ids=None):\n",
    "    new_input_ids = tokenizer.encode(user_input + tokenizer.eos_token, return_tensors='pt')\n",

    "## 4. Potential of LLMs for Personalized Customer Support and Engagement\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Enhanced Customer Experience\n",
    "LLMs are highly effective at simulating natural, conversational interactions, allowing the chatbot to engage customers in a more human-like and engaging manner. This greatly enhances the overall customer experience, as users feel they are interacting with an intelligent agent that understands their needs. The ability of LLMs to understand and process complex queries, while maintaining conversation flow, reduces the need for users to adapt their communication style to the chatbot, resulting in a smoother and more intuitive experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the chatbot’s ability to retain context across queries ensures that customers do not have to repeat themselves. For example, after asking for a product recommendation, users can inquire about the price or rating of one of the recommended items without having to restate which product they are referring to. This increases user satisfaction and reduces frustration, especially in multi-step inquiries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Scalability and Flexibility\n",
    "One of the major advantages of using LLMs in a chatbot is their scalability. Unlike traditional rule-based systems, which require manual updates for each new use case or product offering, LLMs can generalize across a wide range of conversational patterns. This allows the chatbot to handle an evolving product catalog, changing customer preferences, and varied customer interactions without constant reprogramming.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the e-commerce platform grows, so do the demands on customer support. An LLM-powered chatbot can handle a high volume of queries simultaneously, providing real-time responses even during peak shopping periods. This makes it a cost-effective and scalable solution for large e-commerce platforms, where human customer service agents would struggle to keep up with demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Data-Driven Personalization\n",
    "LLMs enable highly personalized interactions by integrating customer data into responses. By analyzing purchase history, browsing patterns, and other behavioral data, the chatbot can tailor recommendations and responses to each customer’s preferences. For example, if a user frequently purchases sports equipment, the chatbot can suggest related items or highlight sales in that category. This level of personalization drives engagement and encourages repeat purchases, as customers feel that the platform understands their needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond recommendations, LLMs can predict future customer behavior by analyzing patterns in past interactions. This predictive capability can be used to proactively suggest products or services that align with the customer’s evolving interests, further enhancing the platform's ability to engage users effectively.\n",

    "## 5. Evaluation of Effectiveness: Customer Satisfaction and Support Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1 Customer Satisfaction\n",
    "The chatbot’s effectiveness is measured through metrics such as **response time** and **customer feedback**. Quick, accurate responses are crucial to maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction. The chatbot’s ability to provide immediate answers to queries, such as product prices or order statuses, helps reduce customer wait times, resulting in a more satisfying user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the chatbot actively solicits feedback from customers at the end of each session, allowing the platform to assess user satisfaction and identify areas for improvement. This feedback is crucial for continuously refining the chatbot’s responses and ensuring that it meets customer expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Function to collect customer feedback after the session\n",
    "def request_feedback():\n",
    "    feedback = input(\"Bot: How would you rate your experience on a scale from 1 to 5? \")\n",
    "    if feedback.isdigit() and 1 <= int(feedback) <= 5:\n",
    "        return int(feedback)\n",
    "    return None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2 Support Efficiency\n",
    "By automating routine tasks such as answering product inquiries and tracking orders, the chatbot significantly reduces the workload on human support staff. This allows human agents to focus on more complex or high-value interactions, improving the overall efficiency of the customer support team. The chatbot is capable of handling thousands of interactions simultaneously, which is particularly beneficial during busy periods like sales events or holiday seasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chatbot’s ability to scale efficiently makes it an invaluable asset for the platform. It can address a wide range of customer concerns without requiring additional staffing, thereby lowering operational costs while maintaining high-quality customer service.\n",

    "## 8. Challenges Encountered and Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "The development of this chatbot presented various challenges, from handling the complexities of natural language understanding to efficiently managing multiple datasets in real time. Each challenge required thoughtful reflection and a strategic approach to ensure the chatbot was effective, responsive, and scalable. The following sections provide a comprehensive discussion of these challenges, how they were overcome, the insights gained, and the collaborative approach taken by the team.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Managing Natural Language Understanding and Intent Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Challenge**: One of the most fundamental challenges in building a chatbot is accurately interpreting user intent, especially when users phrase their questions in diverse ways. For example, a user could ask about product pricing with questions like \"How much is this?\" or \"What’s the price?\" Each variation in language increases the difficulty of intent detection, particularly in a rule-based system where inputs can’t always be anticipated.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Solution**: We adopted a **rule-based approach using regular expressions (regex)** to identify specific patterns that indicate intent, such as \"price of\" or \"order status.\" By prioritizing keywords and identifying patterns associated with particular intents, we made the chatbot more flexible in interpreting user input. This approach was complemented by a **context dictionary** to allow the chatbot to handle follow-up queries naturally by retaining context from prior exchanges.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Team Approach and Reflection**: The team iteratively refined the regex patterns, conducting tests with diverse input samples to identify any gaps in intent detection. We also discussed the possibility of integrating a natural language understanding (NLU) model for more complex language parsing. Through this challenge, we learned that even simple rule-based systems could be significantly enhanced with thoughtful pattern design and context management.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Insights Gained**: Our experience highlighted that while regex is effective for specific intent patterns, the approach is limited by its reliance on predetermined patterns. This insight pushed the team to explore other NLP techniques, such as machine learning-based NLU models, which we plan to integrate in future versions for greater flexibility and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Ensuring Context Awareness for Follow-up Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Challenge**: A natural conversational flow requires the chatbot to handle follow-up questions without needing users to restate information. For instance, after asking about a product's rating, users might immediately inquire about its price without re-specifying the product. Ensuring that the chatbot could remember and reference prior queries was essential to providing a seamless experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Solution**: To address this challenge, we developed a **context management system** that stores key information from each interaction. A dictionary-based structure allowed us to retain relevant details, such as the last product or customer ID discussed, which the chatbot could retrieve when answering follow-up queries. This design made the chatbot feel more conversational and capable of handling complex interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Team Approach and Reflection**: The team engaged in brainstorming sessions to decide on the best structure for context storage, weighing the benefits of a lightweight dictionary approach versus more complex data structures. Our final design choice balanced simplicity and functionality, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of context without adding unnecessary complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Insights Gained**: Implementing context management underscored the importance of memory in conversational AI. This experience reinforced our understanding of how context awareness contributes to user satisfaction and chatbot effectiveness, setting a foundation for future improvements such as session-based memory or user-specific profiles for even richer conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Handling Large and Structured Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Challenge**: The chatbot required access to large datasets containing customer, order, and product information. Ensuring quick data retrieval without sacrificing performance posed a challenge, as each query involved filtering and accessing specific details from potentially extensive data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Solution**: We utilized **Pandas DataFrames** to manage and query data efficiently. By loading customer, order, and product datasets into separate DataFrames and setting indices on key fields (like `customer_id` and `order_id`), we optimized lookup times. This setup allowed the chatbot to handle data-intensive queries in real-time, ensuring a smooth experience for users.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Team Approach and Reflection**: Recognizing that data management would be central to chatbot performance, the team dedicated considerable effort to testing different data-loading strategies. We also discussed potential future optimizations, such as migrating to a relational database if data volume increases. Through collaborative testing, we confirmed that DataFrames offered a good balance of speed and ease of use for our current needs.\n",

As a result, we’re now better prepared to manage data complexity in future projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Generating Conversational Responses with DialoGPT\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Challenge**: While DialoGPT excels at generating conversational text, managing the flow of conversation over multiple exchanges was challenging. Specifically, we needed to ensure that responses remained relevant to the user’s prior queries and did not devolve into repetitive or off-topic text, which can disrupt the user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Solution**: To manage conversation flow, we used **chat history tracking (chat_history_ids)** to keep a record of all previous exchanges within a session. By passing this history back into the model, we ensured that responses were generated with an awareness of past interactions. Additionally, we carefully tuned parameters like **`top_p`** and **`top_k`** to strike a balance between coherence and variability, which prevented repetitive responses and enhanced conversational engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Team Approach and Reflection**: The team spent time experimenting with different parameter settings to find the optimal balance. This process involved trial and error, where we evaluated different configurations and discussed the trade-offs between creativity and relevance. By continuously refining our approach, we were able to maximize the model’s conversational capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Insights Gained**: This challenge underscored the importance of tuning hyperparameters in dialogue models. We learned that even small adjustments to parameters like `top_p` and `top_k` could have a significant impact on the chatbot's ability to produce natural, engaging responses.

    "\n",
    "- **Challenge**: Users often phrase their queries differently, even when asking about the same topic. This variability complicates the process of identifying intent, as the chatbot must be able to interpret a broad range of inputs, including informal language, abbreviations, and synonyms.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Solution**: To address this, we implemented **keyword-based parsing** and **case-insensitive searches** to broaden the chatbot’s language comprehension. Additionally, we applied **punctuation stripping** and **string normalization** techniques to clean and standardize user input, making it easier for the chatbot to identify core intent without being distracted by irrelevant formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Team Approach and Reflection**: Our approach involved brainstorming potential phrasings for common queries and ensuring that the parsing logic could handle these variations. Team members contributed examples of different ways users might phrase questions, which we used to guide our design decisions. This collaborative process helped us build a more robust parsing mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Insights Gained**: We discovered that keyword-based parsing, while effective, has limitations. For future projects, we are considering integrating more sophisticated NLP techniques, such as synonym recognition and phrase embeddings, to improve the chatbot’s adaptability to varied language use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Ensuring Scalability and Adaptability\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Solution**: To future-proof the chatbot, we designed it to be easily scalable by relying on **Pandas DataFrames** for data storage, allowing for dynamic updates. This setup allows the bot to handle new data without requiring code changes. Additionally, the use of a pre-trained LLM (DialoGPT) offers flexibility for future enhancements, as the model can be fine-tuned or replaced with newer models as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Team Approach and Reflection**: Scalability considerations were central to our design discussions. We explored options such as moving to a relational database or integrating a more modular API structure as the platform grows. This proactive approach allowed us to anticipate future needs and build a foundation for sustained growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Insights Gained**: This challenge highlighted the importance of planning for scalability from the start. Our experience taught us that building with growth in mind not only prevents future bottlenecks but also enhances system robustness. We’re now better equipped to design adaptable solutions that can evolve alongside platform demands.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
