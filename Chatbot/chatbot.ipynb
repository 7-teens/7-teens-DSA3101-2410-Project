    "\n",
    "- **Pandas** (`pd`): This is a powerful data manipulation and analysis library, especially useful for working with structured data (like CSV files). We will use it to load and manage the datasets.\n",
    "- **Transformers** (`AutoModelForCausalLM`, `AutoTokenizer`): These functions are part of the Hugging Face library. They allow us to load pre-trained models and tokenizers for natural language processing (NLP). In our case, we use the **DialoGPT** model for generating chatbot responses.\n",
    "- **Torch** (`torch`): A deep learning framework used to manage tensors and pass data through the model. Here, it helps in tokenizing user input and generating the chatbot’s responses.\n",
    "- **re**: Python’s regular expressions module for pattern matching. It’s used to detect intents and extract entities (e.g., customer IDs or product names) from the user's input.\n",
    "- **datetime**: This module helps us manipulate dates and times. We use it to calculate and format last login/check-out dates of customers.\n",
    "- **string**: Used for basic string operations, such as removing punctuation from product names.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. It prompts the user for input and detects whether the input is a **customer query**, **order query**, or **product query** using the `detect_intent_and_entities` function.\n",
    "2. Based on the detected **intent**, the chatbot calls the corresponding helper function:\n",
    "   - If the user asks about a customer, it calls `get_customer_info`.\n",
    "   - For order queries, it calls `get_order_status`.\n",
    "   - For product queries, it calls `get_product_info`.\n",
    "3. If the intent is unclear or doesn’t match any of the specific query types, it defaults to using **DialoGPT** to generate a conversational response.\n",

    "Implementing a chatbot on an e-commerce platform offers significant benefits for both the platform itself and its customers:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. For the E-commerce Platform:**\n",
    "- **Increased Efficiency in Customer Support**: By automating responses to common customer queries such as order status, product details (price, ratings), and customer account information, the platform reduces the load on human customer support representatives. This allows the platform to handle more customers simultaneously without increasing operational costs.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **24/7 Availability**: The chatbot provides uninterrupted support, ensuring that customers can get their queries answered at any time, even outside normal business hours. This improves customer satisfaction and potentially increases sales by assisting customers around the clock.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cost Reduction**: Automating a portion of the customer service reduces the need for hiring large teams of support agents. This results in lower staffing and training costs, enabling the platform to allocate resources to other critical areas like marketing or product development.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Better Data Collection**: The chatbot logs customer interactions, providing the platform with valuable insights into common customer pain points, frequently asked questions, and product-related concerns. This data can be used to improve the platform's offerings and customer experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Faster Response Times**: Chatbots can instantly reply to customer inquiries, leading to a smoother and more responsive customer experience. This helps in reducing bounce rates and cart abandonment, as customers are more likely to make purchases when they get prompt assistance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. For Customers:**\n",
    "- **Immediate Assistance**: Customers no longer have to wait in long queues for help. Whether they need to track an order, ask about a product, or get help with their account, the chatbot can provide immediate responses.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Personalized Experience**: By tracking previous interactions through the chatbot’s **context management**, the platform can provide more personalized responses, such as remembering the last product a customer inquired about or their last order. This personal touch enhances the overall shopping experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Seamless Shopping Experience**: With quick access to product details, prices, and ratings, customers can make informed purchasing decisions without needing to leave the platform or contact support. This reduces friction in the buying process and can lead to increased sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reduced Effort for Repeated Queries**: Customers often need the same information multiple times, such as order tracking. With the chatbot storing context (e.g., last customer, last product), they don’t need to re-enter this information, making the experience more efficient and user-friendly.\n",

    "# Challenges Encountered During Development and How They Were Addressed"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Developing this chatbot involved several challenges, ranging from handling natural language processing (NLP) complexities to managing real-time data from multiple datasets. Here’s a breakdown of the key challenges and the solutions implemented to address them:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Managing Natural Language Understanding and Intent Detection**\n",
    "- **Challenge**: One of the primary challenges in developing a chatbot is accurately understanding the user's intent. Users may ask about the same topic (e.g., product price or order status) in various ways, making it difficult for the chatbot to detect the correct intent and respond appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Solution**: We used regular expressions (`regex`) to match specific patterns in the input that signal intent. For instance, the chatbot looks for keywords such as “price of” or “order ID” to determine whether the user is asking about a product or order. This approach, combined with the use of a context dictionary, allows the chatbot to handle follow-up queries and manage different intents effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Ensuring Context Awareness for Follow-up Queries**\n",
    "- **Challenge**: A key aspect of user experience in chatbots is the ability to handle follow-up questions without requiring users to repeat information. For example, if a user asks for the rating of a product and then asks for its price, the chatbot should remember which product was previously mentioned.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Solution**: We addressed this challenge by implementing a **context management system**. The chatbot stores the last product, customer, or order mentioned in a conversation in a dictionary (`context`). This way, when a user asks a follow-up question, the chatbot can retrieve the relevant information without needing the user to repeat themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Handling Large and Structured Datasets**\n",
    "- **Challenge**: Since the chatbot interacts with multiple datasets (customers, orders, products), managing the data efficiently and querying it in real-time posed a challenge. The chatbot had to search for specific details like customer IDs, product names, and order IDs without performance issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Solution**: To ensure efficient data handling, we used **Pandas** for loading and querying the CSV files. This allowed us to manipulate and filter the data quickly. Data columns were pre-processed to ensure uniform formats, and indices were set for faster lookups (e.g., using `customer_id` or `order_id` as indices). This optimization improved the chatbot’s performance when retrieving customer or product information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Generating Conversational Responses with DialoGPT**\n",
    "- **Challenge**: Creating human-like responses using a pre-trained model (DialoGPT) was another challenge. While DialoGPT generates coherent conversations, it requires proper management of chat history and tokens to maintain the context of the conversation across multiple exchanges.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Solution**: We handled this by maintaining a **chat history** (`chat_history_ids`) to track all user inputs and chatbot responses. The model was initialized with each user input, along with the previous conversation history, allowing it to generate responses that fit the ongoing context. Additionally, parameters like **`top_p`** and **`top_k`** were used to control the randomness of the chatbot’s replies, ensuring the responses were both relevant and varied.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5. Handling User Input Variability**\n",
    "- **Challenge**: Users often phrase their queries differently. For example, someone might ask \"How much is this?\" or \"What’s the price?\" when referring to a product. This variability in language makes it difficult to capture all possible user inputs using fixed rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Solution**: We addressed this challenge by allowing the chatbot to search for keywords (e.g., “price”, “rating”) and applying string manipulation techniques such as removing punctuation and making the search case-insensitive. This increased the flexibility of the chatbot in recognizing user queries. Additionally, when specific information (like a product name) was missing, the chatbot used the **stored context** to infer what the user was referring to.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **6. Ensuring Scalability and Adaptability**\n",
    "- **Challenge**: As the platform grows, more products, customers, and orders will be added to the datasets, increasing the complexity and size of the data that the chatbot needs to handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Solution**: The chatbot was designed to be easily scalable by allowing dynamic updates to the datasets. Since the bot relies on **Pandas** DataFrames, new rows can be added to the CSV files without breaking functionality. Additionally, pre-trained models like DialoGPT are versatile and can be fine-tuned further for specific domain tasks, allowing the chatbot to adapt as the platform’s offerings evolve.\n",
