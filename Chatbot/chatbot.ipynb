    "  - **Pandas** (`pd`) is the main library used to load and manipulate structured data (CSV files) for customers, orders, and products. It will help filter, query, and format data for the chatbot.\n",
    "  - **Transformers**: We use Hugging Face’s pre-trained **DialoGPT** model, which is loaded using `AutoModelForCausalLM` and `AutoTokenizer`. This allows the chatbot to understand and generate natural language text. The model will be the \"brain\" for the conversational logic.\n",
    "  - **Torch**: This deep learning library (PyTorch) is used to handle the tensors passed to the transformer model. It ensures the chatbot can process and generate text using the pre-trained language model.\n",
    "  - **re**: Regular expressions help to detect user intent and extract relevant entities (like customer IDs, product names, etc.) from the user input.\n",
    "  - **Datetime**: This is used to manipulate and format dates for customer and order data (e.g., calculating the last login time or order date).\n",
    "  - **String**: This library is used for text operations, such as cleaning product names by removing punctuation.\n",
    "  - **Time**: We use this library to track the response time of the chatbot for performance evaluation purposes.\n",

    "  - **Core Chatbot Logic**: This function handles the chatbot’s main conversation loop. It continuously prompts the user for input and determines the intent of the query using the `detect_intent_and_entities` function.\n",
    "  - **Tracking Response Times**: The time taken to generate a response is tracked and stored in the `response_times` list. This helps assess the chatbot’s performance.\n",
    "  - **User Feedback Collection**: Before the user exits the conversation, they are asked to rate their experience (on a scale of 1 to 5). The feedback is stored and can be used to evaluate user satisfaction.\n",
    "  - **Handling Various Intents**: The chatbot handles customer queries, order statuses, product prices/ratings, and product recommendations based on the detected intent. If no specific intent is detected, it uses **DialoGPT** to generate a general response.\n",
    "  - The final step calls the `chatbot()` function to start the conversation. This activates the chatbot, allowing it to process user queries, respond based on intents, and collect performance metrics such as response times and user feedback.\n",

    "# Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for Personalized Customer Support: Implementation and Evaluation of an AI Chatbot"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) have significant potential for enhancing personalized customer support and engagement, particularly when implemented as AI chatbots. Evaluating the effectiveness of these chatbots involves assessing their impact on customer satisfaction and support efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following breakdown explains how the chatbot implementation addresses these goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Implementing an AI Chatbot Using an LLM**\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation uses **DialoGPT**, a transformer-based LLM, which is fine-tuned for dialogue generation, making it suitable for customer query handling and product recommendations. Here's how the chatbot functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LLM Integration:**\n",
    "  - The `chat_with_dialoGPT` function utilizes the **DialoGPT** model to process user inputs and generate human-like conversational responses. It manages conversation history to ensure context is retained across user interactions, improving engagement by delivering personalized responses.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Context Management:**\n",
    "  - The chatbot maintains a `context` dictionary, which stores important information such as the last product or last customer ID discussed. This ensures continuity in conversation, allowing for more personalized responses in follow-up queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Handling Customer Queries:**\n",
    "  - **Customer Information Query:** The function `get_customer_info(customer_id)` retrieves customer data, such as last login details and last checkout history. The LLM uses this data to provide relevant responses, enhancing personalization.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - **Order Status Query:** The chatbot can handle queries related to customer orders through `get_order_status(order_id)`, which provides information on the order’s status based on the order ID.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Product Recommendations:**\n",
    "  - The function `recommend_products(customer_id)` suggests new products based on a customer’s purchase history. If the customer has no previous orders, it recommends popular products instead. This level of personalization enhances customer engagement and increases the chances of successful product suggestions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Product Information Query (Price/Rating):**\n",
    "  - Through `get_product_info(product_name, info_type)`, the chatbot can answer questions about product details such as price or rating. It can also follow up on a product from earlier in the conversation, demonstrating the chatbot’s ability to handle specific customer needs effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Evaluating the Effectiveness of the AI Chatbot**\n",
    "\n",
    "The chatbot code includes several metrics and mechanisms to assess its performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficiency (Response Time):**\n",
    "  - The chatbot calculates **response time** for each query using the `time.time()` function. These response times are stored in the `response_times` list and averaged at the end of the session to evaluate how quickly the chatbot responds to user queries.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - **Tracking Total Queries:** The total number of queries is tracked via the `total_queries` variable, allowing the system to assess the chatbot's workload and performance under various conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Customer Satisfaction (Feedback Collection):**\n",
    "  - At the end of the chat session, the function `request_feedback()` prompts users to rate their experience on a scale from 1 to 5. These feedback scores are stored and averaged, giving a direct measure of **customer satisfaction**.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - An average feedback score is calculated and displayed at the end of the session, providing insight into how users perceive the chatbot’s effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Potential of LLMs for Personalized Customer Support**\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation demonstrates the following potential of using LLMs like **DialoGPT** for personalized customer support:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Natural, Human-Like Interactions:**\n",
    "  - The LLM-based chatbot can engage customers in natural, flowing conversations, responding to a wide range of queries and maintaining context across multiple interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Context Awareness:**\n",
    "  - The ability to retain and reference information from previous queries (e.g., customer history, product details) enhances personalization, allowing the chatbot to provide more relevant and tailored responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scalability:**\n",
    "  - The LLM is capable of handling multiple customer queries at once, making it a scalable solution for customer support operations without the need for additional human agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Product and Service Recommendations:**\n",
    "  - By analyzing customer history, the chatbot can offer personalized recommendations, which can improve customer engagement and drive sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Summary of Chatbot Capabilities and Effectiveness**\n",
    "\n",

    "# Potential Benefits of this Chatbot for the E-commerce Platform and Customers"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Implementing a chatbot on an e-commerce platform offers significant benefits for both the platform itself and its customers:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. For the E-commerce Platform:**\n",
    "- **Increased Efficiency in Customer Support**: By automating responses to common customer queries such as order status, product details (price, ratings), and customer account information, the platform reduces the load on human customer support representatives. This allows the platform to handle more customers simultaneously without increasing operational costs.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **24/7 Availability**: The chatbot provides uninterrupted support, ensuring that customers can get their queries answered at any time, even outside normal business hours. This improves customer satisfaction and potentially increases sales by assisting customers around the clock.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cost Reduction**: Automating a portion of the customer service reduces the need for hiring large teams of support agents. This results in lower staffing and training costs, enabling the platform to allocate resources to other critical areas like marketing or product development.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Better Data Collection**: The chatbot logs customer interactions, providing the platform with valuable insights into common customer pain points, frequently asked questions, and product-related concerns. This data can be used to improve the platform's offerings and customer experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Faster Response Times**: Chatbots can instantly reply to customer inquiries, leading to a smoother and more responsive customer experience. This helps in reducing bounce rates and cart abandonment, as customers are more likely to make purchases when they get prompt assistance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. For Customers:**\n",
    "- **Immediate Assistance**: Customers no longer have to wait in long queues for help. Whether they need to track an order, ask about a product, or get help with their account, the chatbot can provide immediate responses.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Personalized Experience**: By tracking previous interactions through the chatbot’s **context management**, the platform can provide more personalized responses, such as remembering the last product a customer inquired about or their last order. This personal touch enhances the overall shopping experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Seamless Shopping Experience**: With quick access to product details, prices, and ratings, customers can make informed purchasing decisions without needing to leave the platform or contact support. This reduces friction in the buying process and can lead to increased sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reduced Effort for Repeated Queries**: Customers often need the same information multiple times, such as order tracking. With the chatbot storing context (e.g., last customer, last product), they don’t need to re-enter this information, making the experience more efficient and user-friendly.\n",

    "# Challenges Encountered During Development and How They Were Addressed"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Developing this chatbot involved several challenges, ranging from handling natural language processing (NLP) complexities to managing real-time data from multiple datasets. Here’s a breakdown of the key challenges and the solutions implemented to address them:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Managing Natural Language Understanding and Intent Detection**\n",
    "- **Challenge**: One of the primary challenges in developing a chatbot is accurately understanding the user's intent. Users may ask about the same topic (e.g., product price or order status) in various ways, making it difficult for the chatbot to detect the correct intent and respond appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Solution**: We used regular expressions (`regex`) to match specific patterns in the input that signal intent. For instance, the chatbot looks for keywords such as “price of” or “order ID” to determine whether the user is asking about a product or order. This approach, combined with the use of a context dictionary, allows the chatbot to handle follow-up queries and manage different intents effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Ensuring Context Awareness for Follow-up Queries**\n",
    "- **Challenge**: A key aspect of user experience in chatbots is the ability to handle follow-up questions without requiring users to repeat information. For example, if a user asks for the rating of a product and then asks for its price, the chatbot should remember which product was previously mentioned.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Solution**: We addressed this challenge by implementing a **context management system**. The chatbot stores the last product, customer, or order mentioned in a conversation in a dictionary (`context`). This way, when a user asks a follow-up question, the chatbot can retrieve the relevant information without needing the user to repeat themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Handling Large and Structured Datasets**\n",
    "- **Challenge**: Since the chatbot interacts with multiple datasets (customers, orders, products), managing the data efficiently and querying it in real-time posed a challenge. The chatbot had to search for specific details like customer IDs, product names, and order IDs without performance issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Solution**: To ensure efficient data handling, we used **Pandas** for loading and querying the CSV files. This allowed us to manipulate and filter the data quickly. Data columns were pre-processed to ensure uniform formats, and indices were set for faster lookups (e.g., using `customer_id` or `order_id` as indices). This optimization improved the chatbot’s performance when retrieving customer or product information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Generating Conversational Responses with DialoGPT**\n",
    "- **Challenge**: Creating human-like responses using a pre-trained model (DialoGPT) was another challenge. While DialoGPT generates coherent conversations, it requires proper management of chat history and tokens to maintain the context of the conversation across multiple exchanges.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Solution**: We handled this by maintaining a **chat history** (`chat_history_ids`) to track all user inputs and chatbot responses. The model was initialized with each user input, along with the previous conversation history, allowing it to generate responses that fit the ongoing context. Additionally, parameters like **`top_p`** and **`top_k`** were used to control the randomness of the chatbot’s replies, ensuring the responses were both relevant and varied.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5. Handling User Input Variability**\n",
    "- **Challenge**: Users often phrase their queries differently. For example, someone might ask \"How much is this?\" or \"What’s the price?\" when referring to a product. This variability in language makes it difficult to capture all possible user inputs using fixed rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Solution**: We addressed this challenge by allowing the chatbot to search for keywords (e.g., “price”, “rating”) and applying string manipulation techniques such as removing punctuation and making the search case-insensitive. This increased the flexibility of the chatbot in recognizing user queries. Additionally, when specific information (like a product name) was missing, the chatbot used the **stored context** to infer what the user was referring to.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **6. Ensuring Scalability and Adaptability**\n",
    "- **Challenge**: As the platform grows, more products, customers, and orders will be added to the datasets, increasing the complexity and size of the data that the chatbot needs to handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Solution**: The chatbot was designed to be easily scalable by allowing dynamic updates to the datasets. Since the bot relies on **Pandas** DataFrames, new rows can be added to the CSV files without breaking functionality. Additionally, pre-trained models like DialoGPT are versatile and can be fine-tuned further for specific domain tasks, allowing the chatbot to adapt as the platform’s offerings evolve.\n",
